## Overview
_This our the first project for Web3Bridges' Web2ACXII, it is a Bank Landing Page._

# Bank Landing Page  

This page is responsive across mobile, taps and PCs. It includes HTML and CSS styling, as well as some JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- styles.css: This is the stylesheet that controls the layout, typography, and responsiveness of the entire website.
